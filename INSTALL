Introduction
============
The application is split into two parts. There is a python package named
'pytic' where the Tic Tac Toe game logic lives, and a 'mysite' django
app that uses the 'pytic' package to create the web applicaton Tic Tac
Toe game. Both of these code bases will need to be setup properly before
the web application will work.

Environment
===========
I suggest using virtualenv to create an isolated enviroment to install and
run this application. There is a file 'requirements.pip' that contains all
the dependencies you will need, with their specific versions, and you can
install these dependencies by running

    pip install -r requirements.pip

from the command line. You might need to use 'sudo' if you are installing
these dependencies to global site-packages.

pytic
=============
To install change directories into the pytic package run

    python setup.py install

from the command line. You might need to use 'sudo' if you are installing
this package to your global site-packages. This command will install the
pytic package.

Django App
==========
To run the django application change directories to the project root and
run

    python manage.py runserver 8080

from the command line. You may need to change 8080 to a different port
if another application is running using 8080. You will receive an error
message if that is the case.

Wrap Up
=======
After following all the instructions you should be able to go to 

     http://localhost:8080

and see the Tic Tac Toe game running in your browser. Enjoy!!
