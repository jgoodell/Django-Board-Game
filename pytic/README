Intro
=====
The package contains all of the types and logic for the Tic Tac Toe game. My personal
strategy with Tic Tac Toe is to block my opponents moves waiting for them to make a
mistake.

Notes
=====
* Just because the AI never loses doesn't mean it wins.
* Each straight line group of winning marks can be thought of as a vector.
* Analysis, the AI has to place it's move in the same vector as the opponent, But now
  to tell what vector?.
    * Opponent's random first move.
    * AI places move in one of 2-4 vectors that will allows the opponent to win.
    * Opponent makes second move, either to block AI or chosing a different vector.
    * AI places next move to block opponent as first priority or make move in a
      success vector basec off of first move.
    * (repeat)
